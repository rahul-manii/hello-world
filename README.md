Hello!

My name is Rahul Manikonda, I'm a grade 11 student at glenforest secondary school and I really want to learn more about coding. Right now I have plenty knowledge on the graphic design side ranging from adobe flash,photoshop,after effects to sony vegas and much more. I like listening to all genres of music and play a few insturments myself. I like to draw and paint and overall I think of myself as an artsy person. lit!
